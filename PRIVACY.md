This privacy policy describes how Steven Weatherspoon ("I", "my") protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data. Before using any of my Alexa Skills (“my skills”), please read this policy, as well as the Alexa Terms of Use and the Privacy Policies by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”).

Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like my skills) and other related
# Software

If you use one of my skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.
# General

When you use my skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and us where it is used to understand what the skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for my service to give you an appropriate answer.
# Data

I never collect or share personal data with my skills.

To improve my services we analyze automatically how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.

For some of my skills it is necessary to save data for you in my databases. This data is only connected to your Alexa-UserId but never to your name or any other personal information and is used only to provide better experiences for repeat users, such as remembering names given.
# Changes

My skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of my skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
